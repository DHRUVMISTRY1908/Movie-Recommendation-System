## Introduction

MovieRec is an intelligent movie recommendation system designed to assist you in discovering new movies based on your preferences. Using content-based filtering, the system analyzes the attributes of movies you've previously enjoyed and suggests similar movies that match your tastes. With the power of cosine similarity, MovieRec ensures that the recommendations are personalized and accurate.

## How it Works

1. **User Preferences:** When you visit MovieRec, you will be asked to rate some movies or provide a list of your favorite movies. This information helps the system understand your movie preferences.

2. **Content-Based Filtering:** The system then analyzes the content and features of the movies you've rated or provided. It takes into account various attributes such as genre, actors, directors, and plot summaries.

3. **Cosine Similarity:** MovieRec uses cosine similarity to measure the similarity between movies. It calculates the cosine of the angle between two movie vectors in a high-dimensional space, helping to identify movies that share common characteristics with the ones you liked.

4. **Personalized Recommendations:** Based on the content-based filtering and cosine similarity calculations, MovieRec generates a list of movie recommendations tailored specifically to your taste. The more you interact with the system, the better it becomes at understanding your preferences and providing accurate suggestions.
